# The POC behind for the code change is for a gallery application where there is no user login but a state is needed for each browser when the user changes view from main Image view and you want to keep state when going back to Image view as the state will change on backend when another person goes to the website. In this example sessionid is the state persistent through the enitire session. Just open 2 instances and check Application tab for Local Storage with key settings of person that keeps the persistent state
